# MeanCloud_7DtD
MeanCloud's a18 7 Days to Die modlets, updated for a19

**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Note**
These mods were originally authored by [MeanCloud  e.g. psouza4](https://community.7daystodie.com/profile/9310-psouza4). I have created ths repo for a19 updates/fixes.  MeanClouds a18 Github repo is [here](https://github.com/psouza4/MeanCloud_7DtD).

Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, MeanCloud gave me permission to "to fork and extend, update, and modify the behavior of any of my mods." per Discord personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date and as close to original purpose/functionality as much as I reasonably can and mods I am able to update in this repo should be the "official continuation" of MeanClouds work until (or if) MeanCloud decides to continue maintainence/updates.  At that time I will make sure MeanClouds has available a copy/pull of the repo/most recent version/etc. and then delete this repo if needed/requested.

I will accept outside pulls/updates/etc. to these mods as long as they maintain continuity with the originals.  This is just a maintenance effort, not an expansion/rebalance unless it is needed as the vanilla game updates often change game dynamics :)

| Modlet | Tested on game version  | Note |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| FarmLife2Mod_A18 | DECOMMED | STATUS: DECOMMED. NOT FOR A19. Will not convert to a19 as this is a very large mod and others are working on "Farm Life" mods from this same source. There are several WIP/not maintained. This appears to be the older base for MeanClouds [Farm Life V2](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12332-farm-life-v2). This appears to be the latest maintained farming mod you should probably use for a19+: [Farm Life Revisited](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23943-farm-life-revisited/)|
